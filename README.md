# AutismAppJam2016
Diary web app designed for autistic users. The user types in his diary entry on his computer or mobile device and reflects upon
that situation. Afterwards the user types in the lesson learned from that situation and submits the diary. The user can read
all the entries he wrote from the home page.

This website uses local storage to store the user's data. It is formatted differently for desktop devices and mobile devices. We used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
